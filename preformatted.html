			I think that I shall never see	
			A poem lovely as a tree.

			A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast;

			A tree that looks at God all day,
			And lifts her leafy arms to pray;

			A tree that may in summer wear
			A nest of robins in her hair;

			Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
			Who intimately lives with rain.

Poems are made by fools like me,
			But only God can make a tree.
